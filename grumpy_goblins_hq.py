**Gameplay and Scoring**

- Games are played in pods as normal multiplayer Commander.

- After each game:
  - Winner receives 0 upgrade points.
  - Each losing player receives 5 upgrade points.

**Bonus Objectives**

- Before each game, 3 random bonus objectives will be drawn.
- Players can earn additional upgrade points by completing these objectives during the game.
- Each objective completed awards 1 point, unless otherwise stated.

**Streak System (Comeback Mechanic)**

- For every consecutive loss, a player earns +1 bonus upgrade point.
- Example: 2 losses in a row = 5 (base) + 2 (streak) = 7 points
- Streak resets after a win.

**Spending Upgrade Points**

- Between game sessions, players may use their upgrade points to build a custom sideboard of cards.
- Cards from the sideboard may be swapped into the main deck between games.

**Upgrade Costs:**

- Basic Lands: 0 points
- Non-Basic & Utility Lands: 1 point each
- Common/Uncommon Cards: 1 point each
- Rare/Mythic Rare Cards: 3 points each
- Game Changer Cards: 7 points each
- Only available to players after theyâ€™ve hit a 3-game loss streak.
- These are high-impact cards that can swing a game.

**League Goals**

- This league is designed to be:
  - Accessible to all skill levels
  - Encouraging gradual deck evolution
  - Focused on fun, camaraderie, and clever deckbuilding over time

*Let the games begin, and may your upgrades be epic!*
